function main() {
    // Your code here
}

module.exports = { main };
I need more context to help you. You've asked about `style.css`, but the file shown is a JavaScript file (`main.js`).

Could you clarify what you'd like to add? Are you looking to:
- Import or reference a CSS file in your JavaScript?
- Create a separate style.css file?
- Add styling-related code to main.js?

Please provide more details about what you're trying to accomplish.
